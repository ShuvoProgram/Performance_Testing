# SQA Performance Testing

## Overview

Performance testing is a crucial aspect of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) aimed at ensuring that software applications perform well under expected workloads. This repository provides tools, scripts, and documentation to help you execute and manage performance tests effectively.

## Objectives

- **Measure Response Times:** Evaluate how quickly the application responds to various requests.
- **Assess Throughput:** Determine the number of transactions the application can handle within a specified time frame.
- **Analyze Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and other system resources during load conditions.
- **Identify Bottlenecks:** Pinpoint areas where the application performance degrades.

## Components

### Test Scripts

The repository includes a collection of test scripts designed to simulate different user interactions and workloads. These scripts are written in popular performance testing tools such as:

- **JMeter**


### Configuration Files

Configuration files are provided to customize the performance tests, allowing you to define parameters like the number of users, test duration, and specific endpoints to target.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java** (for JMeter)
- **Scala** (for Gatling)
- **Python** (for Locust and result analysis)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized testing environments)

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuvoprogramer/sqa-performance-testing.git
cd sqa-performance-testing
